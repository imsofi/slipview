# Slipview
Slipview is a PHP only, no Javascript video streaming and sharing site. It has a registration and login system where users can comment on the different episodes that has been uploaded. The user can also later delete his comment(s) if he/she is not happy with it.

This website was made as a proof of consept and made to be a challenege for me to develop something without the access to javascript, at all. 0 lines of javascript, just pure PHP. >;)
